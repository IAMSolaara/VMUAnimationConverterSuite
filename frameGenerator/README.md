# frameGenerator README

## What you need
 1. A version of Processing installed. I only tried it with Processing 3.5.3 x64 on Windows 10 Pro but it should work on older versions too. The overall program is pretty simple.
 2. Knowledge of the Processing framework, although it is really easy to get a lot done with it so you won't have a problem learning how to use it, trust me.
 3. Nothing else really, other than creativity, of course. Or silliness, silliness is what the world runs on!

## How to use
 1. Modify the `setup` and `draw` function accordingly to what you want your animation to actually show, remembering to keep the final `if` statement so that the frames actually get dumped for you to be able to use them.
 2. That's it.
