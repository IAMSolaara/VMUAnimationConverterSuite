# lcdMaker README

## What you need
 1. Basic knowledge of the Python 3 scripting language.
 2. Some binary frame files. You can generate them with the `frameGenerator` Processing sketch you probably read about in the repo's README. Put them into the `frames` folder. If you got them from the Processing sketch just copy that whole folder over here.

## How to use
 1. Obtain your desired binary frame files and put them in a folder named `frames` in the same folder the script's in.
 2. Run the script with `python3 main.py`.
 3. The output `out/out.lcd` file will be generated. The file is usable in Dream Animator and in the LCD_ANIM program from [here](https://www.deco.franken.de/myfiles/myfiles.html).
 4. Profit and ENJOY!
