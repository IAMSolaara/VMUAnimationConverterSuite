# Dreamcast VMUConverterSuite README

## Programs list:
 * [`frameGenerator`](./frameGenerator): a Processing sketch that generates the frames needed for the lcdMaker script, this examples uses the famous DVD player screensaver animation.
 * [`lcdMaker`](./lcdMaker): a Python3 script that converts and combines binary frames into .lcd files
 * `img2frame`: a failed attempt at straight converting a jpeg into the binary frames in Python3, I suggest you only check it to actually improve it as it's kind of useless with the Processing sketch doing a much better job overall. 

 READMEs for each program (except for `img2frame`) are in each program's folder.

# I hope this little suite helped you make kickass VMU animations!
